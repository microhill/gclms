Great Commission LMS is an open source e-learning platform (also known as a Course Management System (CMS), or Learning Management Systems (LMS), or Virtual Learning Environment (VLE)). It can also accurately be called an Learning Content Management System (LCMS), since it enables users to create learning content.

Our goals are to:

  * make the online learning experience enjoyable. Our design and usability philosophy has a focus on [perceived simplicity](http://www.uxmatters.com/MT/archives/000151.php).
  * make it easy and inexpensive for seminaries, churches, and other groups to train and educate.
  * enable and encourage public accessibility to curriculum even without participating in the online classroom experience.
  * enable and encourage the use of empowering [Creative Commons licenses](http://creativecommons.org/license/) so that course content is freely redistributable.
  * deliver SEO-friendly markup.

We use the [CakePHP](http://cakephp.org/) platform for breezy development and better manageability of code.
